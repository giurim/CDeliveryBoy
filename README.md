# CDeliveryBoy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/szpak/CDeliveryBoy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/szpak/CDeliveryBoy) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/info.solidsoft.gradle/cdeliveryboy/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/info.solidsoft.gradle/cdeliveryboy)

Continuous Delivery solution for Gradle based FOSS projects.

## Vision

Long time ago the vision sprung to my mind. Starting my new FOSS project I would like to be able to get a (doing nothing) template with all build-related stuff and Continuous Delivery to the Central Repository fully configured withing a few (at most several) minutes. Just to be able to immediately focus on the main problem to solve (aka "business logic"), not the infrastructure around. CDeliveryBoy is an attempt to achieve that. I already use it in my [projects](https://github.com/szpak/mockito-java8/) and there is a chance it can be useful also for some other FOSS authors.

## Quick start

To be precisely defined. In the meantime please take a look at the [Dummy CD project](https://github.com/szpak/dummy-cd-project/tree/cDeliveryBoy)
(a cDeliveryBoy branch) with sample (working) configuration or CDeliveryBoy project itself.
 
## Features

This plugin provides (on its own or by internally orchestrating other plugins) the following release steps:
 - version management
 - artifacts building
 - tagging and pushing changes back to GitHub
 - promotion of uploaded artifacts to Maven Central

After initial configuration the whole release process is performed automatically on Travis when requested by a command placed in a commit message.

## Requirements

The project should fulfill the following conditions:
 - configured artifacts upload to Sonatype Nexus OSS (with artifacts signing)
 - configured Travis build

Hint: [gradle-template](https://github.com/szpak/gradle-template/tree/cDeliveryBoy) could be as a starting point. 

## Sample configuration

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'info.solidsoft.gradle:cdeliveryboy:0.3.0'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'info.solidsoft.cdeliveryboy'

cDeliveryBoy {
    autoPromote = false
}

nexusStaging {
    packageGroup = "YOUR-PACKAGE-GROUP-IN-NEXUS"
}

scmVersion {
}

project.version = scmVersion.version
```

## Rationale

I've been tired of manual releasing the FOSS projects I maintain. Being professionally deeply involved in Continuous Delivery of high quality
"Enterprise-Class applications" I wanted to have a light version of CD available for me and other people prefering automation and convenience.

## Additional information 

**The project is available as a technology preview and it definitely will be evolving in the way that breaks backward compatibility.
Please take it into account before using it in production.**
